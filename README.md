# TransCrypto

Basic crypto primitives, not intended for actual use, but as a companion to "Criptografia, Métodos e Algoritmos".

Started in July/2025, by Daniel Balparda. Since version 1.0.2 it is PyPI package:

<https://pypi.org/project/transcrypto/>

## Use

Design assumptions:

* Everything **should work**, as the library is **extensively tested**, *but not necessarily the most efficient or safe for real-world cryptographic use.* For real-world crypto use other optimized/safe libraries.
* All library methods' `int` are tailored to be efficient with arbitrarily large integers (≥ 0).
* *All operations here can be vulnerable to timing attacks.*

### Install

To use in your project just do:

```sh
pip3 install transcrypto
```

and then `from transcrypto import rsa` (or other parts of the library) for using it.

### Base Library

#### Computing the Greatest Common Divisor

```py
>>> from transcrypto import base
>>> base.GCD(462, 1071)
21
>>> base.GCD(0, 17)
17
```

The function is `O(log(min(a, b)))` and handles arbitrarily large integers. To find Bézout coefficients `(x, y)` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)` do:

```py
>>> base.ExtendedGCD(462, 1071)
(21, -2, 1)
>>> 462 * -2 + 1071 * 1
21
```

Use-cases:

* modular inverses: `inv = x % m` when `gcd(a, m) == 1`
* solving linear Diophantine equations
* RSA / ECC key generation internals

#### Fast Modular Arithmetic

```py
m = 2**256 - 189    # a large prime modulus

# Inverse ──────────────────────────────
x = 123456789
x_inv = modmath.ModInv(x, m)
assert (x * x_inv) % m == 1

# Division (x / y) mod m ──────────────
y = 987654321
z = modmath.ModDiv(x, y, m)      # solves z·y ≡ x (mod m)
assert (z * y) % m == x % m

# Exponentiation ──────────────────────
exp = modmath.ModExp(3, 10**20, m)   # ≈ log₂(y) time, handles huge exponents
```

#### Polynomials under a modulus & Lagrange interpolation

```py
# f(t) = 7t³ − 3t² + 2t + 5  (coeffs constant-term first)
coeffs = [5, 2, -3, 7]
print(modmath.ModPolynomial(11, coeffs, 97))   # → 19

# Given three points build the degree-≤2 polynomial and evaluate it.
pts = {2: 4, 5: 3, 7: 1}
print(modmath.ModLagrangeInterpolate(9, pts, 11))   # → 2
```

#### Primality testing & Prime generators, Mersenne primes

```py
modmath.IsPrime(2**127 - 1)              # True  (Mersenne prime)
modmath.IsPrime(3825123056546413051)     # False (strong pseudo-prime)

# Direct Miller–Rabin with custom witnesses
modmath.MillerRabinIsPrime(961748941, witnesses={2,7,61})

# Infinite iterator of primes ≥ 10⁶
for p in modmath.PrimeGenerator(1_000_000):
    print(p)
    if p > 1_000_100:
        break

# Secure random 384-bit prime (for RSA/ECC experiments)
p384 = modmath.NBitRandomPrime(384)

for k, m_p, perfect in modmath.MersennePrimesGenerator(0):
    print(f'p = {k:>8}  M = {m_p}  perfect = {perfect}')
    if k > 10000:          # stop after a few
        break
```

## Development Instructions

### Setup

If you want to develop for this project, first install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/), but make sure it is like this:

```sh
brew uninstall poetry
python3.11 -m pip install --user pipx
python3.11 -m pipx ensurepath
# re-open terminal
poetry self add poetry-plugin-export@^1.8  # allows export to requirements.txt (see below)
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true  # creates venv inside project directory
poetry config pypi-token.pypi <TOKEN>      # add you personal project token
```

Now install the project:

```sh
brew install python@3.13 git
brew update
brew upgrade
brew cleanup -s
# or on Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install python3.13-venv git

git clone https://github.com/balparda/transcrypto.git transcrypto
cd transcrypto

poetry env use python3.13  # creates the venv
poetry install --sync      # HONOR the project's poetry.lock file, uninstalls stray packages
poetry env info            # no-op: just to check

poetry run pytest -vvv
# or any command as:
poetry run <any-command>
```

To activate like a regular environment do:

```sh
poetry env activate
# will print activation command which you next execute, or you can do:
source .env/bin/activate                         # if .env is local to the project
source "$(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate"  # for other paths

pytest

deactivate
```

### Updating Dependencies

To update `poetry.lock` file to more current versions:

```sh
poetry update  # ignores current lock, updates, rewrites `poetry.lock` file
poetry run pytest
```

To add a new dependency you should:

```sh
poetry add "pkg>=1.2.3"  # regenerates lock, updates env
# also: "pkg@^1.2.3" = latest 1.* ; "pkg@~1.2.3" = latest 1.2.* ; "pkg@1.2.3" exact
poetry export --format requirements.txt --without-hashes --output requirements.txt
```

If you added a dependency to `pyproject.toml`:

```sh
poetry run pip3 freeze --all  # lists all dependencies pip knows about
poetry lock     # re-lock your dependencies, so `poetry.lock` is regenerated
poetry install  # sync your virtualenv to match the new lock file
poetry export --format requirements.txt --without-hashes --output requirements.txt
```

### Creating a New Version

```sh
# bump the version!
poetry version minor  # updates 1.6 to 1.7, for example
# or:
poetry version patch  # updates 1.6 to 1.6.1
# or:
poetry version <version-number>
# (also updates `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`)

# publish to GIT, including a TAG
git commit -a -m "release version 1.0.2"
git tag 1.0.2
git push
git push --tags

# prepare package for PyPI
poetry build
poetry publish
```
