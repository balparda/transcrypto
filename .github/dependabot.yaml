  # Poetry projects are configured using the "pip" ecosystem in Dependabot.
  #
  # Important limitation (current GitHub docs):
  # - Dependabot can update pyproject.toml for PEP 621 *in pip mode*,
  #   but the PEP 621 [project] section is not currently supported for "poetry".
  # - Practically, many Poetry repos see Dependabot update poetry.lock more reliably
  #   than editing version constraints in pyproject.toml.
  #
  # This still provides value for lockfile refreshes + security update PRs.
